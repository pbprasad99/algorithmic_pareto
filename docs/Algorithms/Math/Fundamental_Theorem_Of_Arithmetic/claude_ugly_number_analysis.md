# The Ugly Number Problem

This is a Conversation with Claude 4.0 about the solution to the [Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/){target="_blank"} Problem.

## PROMPT

Can you add mathematical expressions for this explanation : 

Solution for : https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/

Problem Statement: An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

This is a great number theory problem,
The fundamental theorem of arithmetic, also callled the prime factorization theorem states that any number greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be expressed as a product of prime numbers (ignoring the order).

12 = 2 * 2 * 3 = 2**2 * 3

210 = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7

By definition of ugnliness as stated in the problem, 12 is  ugly but 210 is not because it has 7 as a factor.
To test ugliness, all you have to do is remove all the factors of 2,3 and 5  and assert that only 1 remains.

But, what does it mean to remove, say ONE factor of 2 from some number x.
It means, that the number x has is made up by adding some other number twice x = x/2 + x/2.
We can test this by checking if 2 divides x evenly i.e. x%2 = 0
Removing one factor of two means removing one copy of x/2 from x.
We keep doing this until x%2 != 0, to remove all factors of 2.
Of the remaining number y, it can be said that there is no other number which if added to itself will yield y.


Similarly, for 3, after removing all factors of 3 from x, 
of the remaining number y, it can be said that there is no other number which if added to itself thrice will yield y.

Here's the solution with mathematical expressions added to make the concepts clearer:

### Solution for Ugly Number Problem

**Problem Statement:** An ugly number is a positive integer which does not have a prime factor other than 2, 3, and 5.

#### Mathematical Foundation

The **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic** states that every integer `n > 1` can be uniquely expressed as:

```
n = p₁^a₁ × p₂^a₂ × p₃^a₃ × ... × pₖ^aₖ
```

where `p₁, p₂, ..., pₖ` are distinct prime numbers and `a₁, a₂, ..., aₖ` are positive integers.

**Examples:**
- `12 = 2² × 3¹` (ugly - only primes 2 and 3)
- `210 = 2¹ × 3¹ × 5¹ × 7¹` (not ugly - contains prime 7)

#### Definition of Ugliness

A number `n` is ugly if and only if:
```
n = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c
```
where `a, b, c ≥ 0` are non-negative integers.

#### Algorithm: Factor Removal

To test ugliness, we systematically remove all factors of 2, 3, and 5:

**Step 1: Remove all factors of 2**
```
While n ≡ 0 (mod 2):
    n ← n/2
```
This continues until `n ≢ 0 (mod 2)`, meaning no more factors of 2 remain.

**Step 2: Remove all factors of 3**
```
While n ≡ 0 (mod 3):
    n ← n/3
```

**Step 3: Remove all factors of 5**
```
While n ≡ 0 (mod 5):
    n ← n/5
```

#### Mathematical Proof of Correctness

After removing all factors of 2, 3, and 5, we have:
```
n_final = n_original / (2^a × 3^b × 5^c)
```

**Case 1:** If `n_original` was ugly, then `n_original = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c`, so:
```
n_final = (2^a × 3^b × 5^c) / (2^a × 3^b × 5^c) = 1
```

**Case 2:** If `n_original` was not ugly, then `n_original = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c × p₁^d₁ × ... × pₖ^dₖ` where `pᵢ ∉ {2,3,5}`, so:
```
n_final = (2^a × 3^b × 5^c × p₁^d₁ × ... × pₖ^dₖ) / (2^a × 3^b × 5^c) = p₁^d₁ × ... × pₖ^dₖ > 1
```

#### Modular Arithmetic Interpretation

When we check `n % 2 == 0`, we're testing the congruence:
```
n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
```

This is equivalent to asking: "Does there exist an integer `k` such that `n = 2k`?"

If yes, then 2 is a factor, and we can "remove" it by setting `n ← k = n/2`.

#### Implementation

```python
def isUgly(n):
    """
    Determines if n is an ugly number.
    
    Mathematical approach: n is ugly iff n = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c for some a,b,c ≥ 0
    
    Args:
        n: integer to test
    
    Returns:
        bool: True if n is ugly, False otherwise
    """
    # Base case: ugly numbers must be positive
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    
    # Remove all factors of 2: n ← n/2 while n ≡ 0 (mod 2)
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    
    # Remove all factors of 3: n ← n/3 while n ≡ 0 (mod 3)
    while n % 3 == 0:
        n //= 3
    
    # Remove all factors of 5: n ← n/5 while n ≡ 0 (mod 5)
    while n % 5 == 0:
        n //= 5
    
    # If n = 2^a × 3^b × 5^c originally, then n = 1 now
    # If n had other prime factors, then n > 1 now
    return n == 1
```

#### Implementation### Time and Space Complexity

**Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`

- In the worst case, we divide by 2 approximately `log₂(n)` times
- Similarly for factors of 3 and 5
- Total: `O(log₂(n) + log₃(n) + log₅(n)) = O(log n)`

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

- Only using a constant amount of extra space

The mathematical foundation shows that this algorithm correctly identifies ugly numbers by leveraging the unique prime factorization and systematically removing the allowed prime factors through modular arithmetic operations.

## PROMPT

Explain this notation :n ← n/5 while n ≡ 0 (mod 5)

## RESPONSE

Excellent! Let me break down this chain of mathematical equivalences step by step:

### The Triple Equivalence

```
n ≡ 0 (mod 5) ⟺ n % 5 == 0 ⟺ ∃k ∈ ℤ such that n = 5k
```

The symbol `⟺` means **"if and only if"** - these three statements are completely equivalent and mean exactly the same thing.

### Statement 1: `n ≡ 0 (mod 5)`

**Reading:** "n is congruent to 0 modulo 5"

**Mathematical Definition:** Two integers are congruent modulo m if they have the same remainder when divided by m.

Since we're comparing n to 0:
- `n ≡ 0 (mod 5)` means n and 0 have the same remainder when divided by 5
- The remainder when 0 is divided by 5 is 0
- Therefore: n has remainder 0 when divided by 5

### Statement 2: `n % 5 == 0`

**Reading:** "n modulo 5 equals 0" or "the remainder when n is divided by 5 is 0"

**Programming Context:** This is how we write modular arithmetic in most programming languages.

**Examples:**
- `10 % 5 = 0` ✓
- `15 % 5 = 0` ✓  
- `17 % 5 = 2` ✗
- `23 % 5 = 3` ✗

### Statement 3: `∃k ∈ ℤ such that n = 5k`

**Reading:** "There exists an integer k such that n equals 5 times k"

**Symbol Breakdown:**

- `∃` = "there exists"
- `k ∈ ℤ` = "k is an element of the integers" (k is a whole number: ..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...)
- `n = 5k` = "n equals 5 times k"

**Meaning:** n can be written as some integer multiplied by 5 (i.e., n is a multiple of 5)

### Why These Are All Equivalent

Let me prove these equivalences with examples:

#### Example 1: n = 20

**Statement 1:** `20 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`
- 20 ÷ 5 = 4 remainder 0 ✓

**Statement 2:** `20 % 5 == 0`  
- 20 % 5 = 0 ✓

**Statement 3:** `∃k ∈ ℤ such that 20 = 5k`
- k = 4 works: 20 = 5 × 4 ✓

#### Example 2: n = 17

**Statement 1:** `17 ≡ 0 (mod 5)`
- 17 ÷ 5 = 3 remainder 2 ≠ 0 ✗

**Statement 2:** `17 % 5 == 0`
- 17 % 5 = 2 ≠ 0 ✗

**Statement 3:** `∃k ∈ ℤ such that 17 = 5k`
- No integer k works: 17/5 = 3.4 (not an integer) ✗

### The Mathematical Connection

#### Division Algorithm

For any integers n and 5, we can write:
```
n = 5q + r    where 0 ≤ r < 5
```
- q is the quotient
- r is the remainder

### The Three Statements Are Saying:
1. **Modular:** The remainder r equals 0
2. **Programming:** The remainder operation gives 0  
3. **Algebraic:** We can write n as 5 times some integer (when r = 0, then n = 5q)

## Practical Examples

| n | n ÷ 5 | Quotient (q) | Remainder (r) | n ≡ 0 (mod 5)? | n % 5 | k exists? | n = 5k |
|---|-------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 0 | 0 ÷ 5 | 0 | 0 | ✓ | 0 | ✓ (k=0) | 0 = 5×0 |
| 5 | 5 ÷ 5 | 1 | 0 | ✓ | 0 | ✓ (k=1) | 5 = 5×1 |
| 10 | 10 ÷ 5 | 2 | 0 | ✓ | 0 | ✓ (k=2) | 10 = 5×2 |
| 12 | 12 ÷ 5 | 2 | 2 | ✗ | 2 | ✗ | 12 ≠ 5k |
| -15 | -15 ÷ 5 | -3 | 0 | ✓ | 0 | ✓ (k=-3) | -15 = 5×(-3) |

### Key Insight

All three expressions are different ways of asking the same fundamental question:

**"Is n a multiple of 5?"**

- **Modular arithmetic** asks: "Does n have remainder 0 when divided by 5?"
- **Programming** asks: "Does the modulo operation return 0?"  
- **Algebraic** asks: "Can we write n as 5 times some integer?"

They're all equivalent ways of expressing divisibility!
