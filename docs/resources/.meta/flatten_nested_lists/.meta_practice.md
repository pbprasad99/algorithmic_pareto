Given a nested list, flatten it so that it becomes a 1-D list.

Constraints

The input variable nested_list must be a list.

The elements of nested_list can be of any type, including integers, floats, strings, or other nested lists.

The nested lists can have any level of nesting, including empty lists.

The elements of the nested lists can be of any type, including integers, floats, strings, or other nested lists.


Test Case #1
Input: [[1, 2, [3, 4], 5], [6], [7, [8, [9, 10]]]]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Description: This test case evaluates the functionâ€™s ability to handle multiple levels of nesting and various list substructures to achieve a correct flattened list.
Test Case #2
Input: [[1, "a", [3.1415, [true, 0]], "b"], [null, [2, [3, "text"]]]]
Output: [1, "a", 3.1415, true, 0, "b", null, 2, 3, "text"]
Description: The function is tested for its ability to handle mixed data types including integers, strings, floats, booleans, and null values within nested lists.
Test Case #3
Input: [[[[]]], [], [[], [[], [[]]]]]
Output: []
Description: This case assesses the algorithm"s efficiency and accuracy in dealing with deeply nested empty lists, ensuring the output remains an empty list when no elements are present.
