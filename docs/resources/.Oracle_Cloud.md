# Oracle Cloud Notes

When you create the account, you have to select a Home region, which cannot be changed later. In my case I selected US East (Ashburn).

## Cloud shell

You get 5GB of storage.
You can run docker in the shell


The shell supposedly supports Java?

```
We support the following programming languages in Cloud Shell so you can write your own applications:
    *  Java including multiple versions of Oracle Java as well as GraalVM Enterprise JDK 17
    *  Python (2 and 3)
    *  Ruby
    *  Golang
    *  JavaScript/NodeJS
    *  C/C++ using gcc
    *  sh and bash scripts
```

I wonder how..

Take a look at this :
https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellquickstart_java.htm

So, not really like a repl, then. What they mean is , you CAN run run java -cp on the cloudshell.  Misleading language.

## Code Editor
So, they have a code editor too..

```
Cloud Shell integrates seamlessly with the OCI Code Editor, allowing you to edit code, modify scripts, and update service workflows directly from the OCI Console.

The Code Editor lets you browse, view, and edit files in your Cloud Shell home directory and provides a convenient way to perform common code updates for various services, including creating and deploying Functions, editing Terraform configurations used with Resource
Manager stacks, and creating and editing an API. It offers the following capabilities that enhance your productivity:

    *  Built-in integration with OCI services, including Functions, Resource Manager, and Data Science
    *  Access to Cloud Shell and 30+ cloud-based tools
    *  Git integration and workspace management
    *  Rich language support
    *  Session continuity
    *  Personalized user experience

You can access this from the View menu in the Cloud Shell window or directly from the Developer Tools icon in the Console header.
```

And of course jave is front and center :

```bash
You can use csruntimectl to configure your version of Java.

To see the set of available Java versions see csruntimectl java list . Your current JDK is indicated by an *.
Hit return to list the JDKs available on this system: 

$ csruntimectl java list

   graalvmeejdk-17                                               /usr/lib64/graalvm/graalvm22-ee-java17
   oraclejdk-1.8                                              /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-1.8.0_471-oracle-aarch64
 * oraclejdk-11                                                 /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.29-oracle-aarch64


You can then set the JDK version by using the command csruntimectl java set <version from above>

Hit return to show your current JAVA_HOME: 

$ echo $JAVA_HOME

/usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11.0.29-oracle-aarch64
```

You can upload and download files to and from your 5gb cloud shell storage :

```
In addition to creating new files and scripts, you can upload files to and download files from your Cloud Shell.

Under the tools (aka gear) icon on the top right corner of the Cloud Shell header are three options related to File Upload/Download:

    *  Download - allows you to transfer files from your Cloud Shell to your local computer
    *  Upload - allows you to transfer files from to Cloud Shell from your local computer
    *  File Transfers - allows you to view active and completed Uploads and Downloads

To Upload files, you can either drag an drop files into the upload dialog (or even directly into Cloud Shell) or use the file selection dialog to select individual files.

Try dragging a file into the Cloud Shell window to try to upload now.

To Download files, you will have to enter the path starting at your home directory in the dialog box. For example, if your file was in ~/temp/myfile you would enter temp/myfile.
```

Important to note that your cloud shell host and storage always reside in your home region.


```
Your Cloud Shell host (and your home directory) live in the Home Region for your tenancy regardless of what region is selected in the region pull-down menu in the top right corner of the console. This allows your home directory to be available no matter what region 
you are operating in.

Your current region (the region you have selected in the pull-down) is used when accessing tenancy resources using the OCI Command Line Interface (CLI) or the OCI Software Development Kits (SDKs).

In the current Cloud Shell Session:

    *  Your Home region is us-ashburn-1
    *  Your Console selected region is us-ashburn-1


Note: The region used by the SDKs/CLIs is "sticky" based on what was selected in the console when your Cloud Shell was opened and persists as long as the session exists. You can identify what region is active by looking at the Cloud Shell prompt. It will look like:

    <username>@cloudshell:<directory> (<region>)

If you want to change your region for the CLI/SDK:

    *  Select a new region in the Console region pull-down menu, near the top of the Console.
    *  Close and reopen your terminal.

```

Cloud Shell has egress access by default :

```
By default, your Cloud Shell uses our Public Network which is provisioned with both a Service Gateway and additionally has egress to the internet. From your Cloud Shell Public Network connection, you can run OCI CLI commands to access tenancy resources and also reach
public resources. The access to public resources allows you to perform tasks like using ssh to access public instances, managing public OKE Clusters and pulling from public git repositories.

If you would like to access resources which do not have a public IP, you can instead use a Private Network Connection. Using Private Network Access, you can connect to a subnet (assuming your administrator has granted you permission) that lives in your home region.

See: https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/cloudshellintro.htm#Cloud_Shell_Private_Access

Note: No ingress to your Cloud Shell Hosts (in either public or private networks) is supported.
```
